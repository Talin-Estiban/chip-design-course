# chip-design-course
This project was a part of the chip design course I took in June. Through the course, I acquired expertise in Verilog, SystemVerilog, and UVM verification methodology and I've been strengthening this expertise since. 
Recently I've been going over the project from the beginning and redesigning the testbench and design code from zero. Now you can see the full design and testbench that I have completed!
