# Chip Design Course Project

This repository showcases my work during a chip design course I undertook in June. Throughout the course, I gained proficiency in Verilog, SystemVerilog, and the UVM verification methodology, and I have been further refining these skills ever since.
Recently, I revisited the project, starting from scratch by redesigning both the testbench and design code. Here, you can explore the comprehensive set of design and testbench files that I have developed.

Inside the repository, you'll find:
- A folder containing all the UVM testbench files.
- Design specifications sheet.
- Verification plan.
- RTL design.
Feel free to delve into the details of the chip design process that I have documented and implemented. This project represents a valuable part of my ongoing journey in chip design and verification.
