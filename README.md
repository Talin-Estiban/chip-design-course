# chip-design-course
This project was a part of the chip design course I took in June. Recently I've been going over the project from the beginning and doing the testbench and design from zero. At this stage, I'm working on designing the CCL unit (there are no errors when running in the EDA playground!). You can check my progress every week and I would love to hear your comments and tips. 
Through the course, I acquired expertise in Verilog, SystemVerilog, and UVM verification methodology and I've been strengthening these expertise since.
